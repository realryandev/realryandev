# Hi there! 👋🏿

I'm Ryan a Frontend Developer based in South Africa

I like being able to apply my coding knowledge to make fast and attractive sites. My goal is to build fast, reliable and easy to navigate websites while still providing engagement and a great experience for users.

## 🧘 Beyond Code

Outside of coding I enjoy:

* Making music for fun
* Spending quality time with friends
* My favorite anime is Ron Kamonohashi's Forbidden Deductions.
